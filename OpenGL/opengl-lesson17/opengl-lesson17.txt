---[ Information ]---------------------------------------------------

This column will be posted to the Taygeta Forth Achive site:

ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/Archive/tutorials/gforth-sdl-opengl/

in the file:

     opengl-lesson17.zip

along with all required source files.

It may take a little time for the files to be moved to the above
directory, so keep checking until they have been placed there.

for the description of what is going on with this code.

---[ Additions ]-----------------------------------------------------

Additions to the mini-opengl libcc interface for this lesson are:

gl-ortho ( left right bottom top zNear zFar -- )

    Multiply the current matrix with an orthographic matrix

    Parameters are all 32-bit floating point values.

      left, right: Specify the coordinates for the left and right
          vertical clipping planes.

      bottom, top: Specify the coordinates for the bottom and top
          horizontal clipping planes.

      zNear, zFar: Specify the distances to the nearer and farther
          depth clipping planes. These values are negative if the
          plane is to be behind the viewer.

    (In gforth, as these are passed by value, there is no conversion
    necessary to make these values into 32-bit floats from the normal
    gforth 64-bit floating point values.)

gl-pop-matrix ( -- )
gl-push-matrix ( -- )

    Push and pop the current matrix stack.

    Parameters: none.

    Description:  There is a stack of matrices for each of the matrix
    modes. In GL_MODELVIEW mode, the stack depth is at least 32. In
    the other modes, GL_COLOR, const(PROJECTION), and GL_TEXTURE, the
    depth is at least 2. The current matrix in any mode is the matrix
    on the top of the stack for that mode.

    glPushMatrix pushes the current matrix stack down by one,
    duplicating the current matrix. That is, after a glPushMatrix
    call, the matrix on top of the stack is identical to the one
    below it.

    glPopMatrix pops the current matrix stack, replacing the current
    matrix with the one below it on the stack.

    Initially, each of the stacks contains one matrix, an identity
    matrix.

    It is an error to push a full matrix stack, or to pop a matrix
    stack that contains only a single matrix. In either case, the
    error flag is set and no other change is made to GL state.

gl-translate-d ( x y z -- )

    Multiply the current matrix by a translation matrix, using 64-bit
    C/C++ floating point values.
    
    Parameters <x>, <y> and <z> are 64-bit floating point values.
    
    x/y/z: Specify the x, y, and z coordinates of a translation
        vector.

    (In gforth these are passed by value and there is no conversion
    necessary as they are already in the required 64-bit format.)

gl-vertex-2f ( x y -- )

    Specify a vertex.
    
    Parameters <x> and <y> are 32-bit floating point values.

      x/y: Specify the x,y coordinates of a vertex.    

    (In gforth, as these are passed by value, there is no conversion
    necessary to make these values into 32-bit floats from the normal
    gforth 64-bit floating point values.)

gl-vertex-2i ( x y -- )

    Specify a vertex.
    
    Parameters <x> and <y> are integer values.

      x/y: Specify the x,y coordinates of a vertex.    

---[ Installation ]--------------------------------------------------

If you are placing all of the Lessons in one directory, copy these
three files to that directory:

        opengl-lesson17.fs      - Code Addendum 1
        opengllib-1.17.fs       - Code Addendum 2
        mini-opengl-1.17.fs     - Code Addendum 3

This Lesson requires the mini-sdl-1.01.fs file from Lesson 6, as well
as all of the usual constants definition files.

This Lesson also uses two image files which you can retrieve from the
NeHe Lesson 17 page at:

      http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/lessons/lesson.asp?lesson=17

or from the opengl-lesson17.zip file that will be posted to the
Taygeta Forth Archives site listed at the start of this column.

For the files from the opengl-lesson17.zip, extract them to wherever
you wish to place them, or extract the above three files and the data
directory into the directory you have placed the previous Lesson
files.

To use the LibUtil script, set the flag in opengllib-1.17.fs:

        1 constant UseLibUtil

and then run the script to install the files to the ~/.gforth dirs:

        cd <your-directory> <cr>
        ./libutil.sh -ra <cr>
        ./libutil.sh -i <cr>
        gforth
        include opengl-lesson17.fs
        lesson17

If you prefer not to use the LibUtil script, set the flag to:

        0 constant UseLibUtil

and then you can execute the Lesson code with:

        cd <your-directory> <cr>
        gforth
        include opengl-lesson17.fs
        lesson17
