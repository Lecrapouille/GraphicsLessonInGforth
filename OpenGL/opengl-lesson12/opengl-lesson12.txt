---[ Information ]---------------------------------------------------

This column will be posted to the Taygeta Forth Achive site:

ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/Archive/tutorials/gforth-sdl-opengl/

in the file:

     opengl-lesson12.zip

along with all required source files.

It may take a little time for the files to be moved to the above
directory, so keep checking until they have been placed there.

---[ Where We Are ]--------------------------------------------------

Read thru the Tutorial for Lesson 12 at

                      www.nehe.gamedev.net

for the description of what is going on with this code.

---[ Additions ]-----------------------------------------------------

Additions to the mini-opengl libcc interface for this lesson are:

gl-call-list ( list -- )

    Execute a display list
    
    Parameter <list> is an integer value, representing a "name"

    Description:

        glCallList causes the named display list to be executed. The
        commands saved in the display list are executed in order,
        just as if they were called without using a display list. If
        list has not been defined as a display list, glCallList is
        ignored.

        glCallList can appear inside a display list. To avoid the
        possibility of infinite recursion resulting from display
        lists calling one another, a limit is placed on the nesting
        level of display lists during display-list execution. This
        limit is at least 64, and it depends on the implementation.

        GL state is not saved and restored across a call to
        glCallList. Thus, changes made to GL state during the
        execution of a display list remain after execution of the
        display list is completed. Use glPushAttrib, glPopAttrib,
        glPushMatrix, and glPopMatrix to preserve GL state across
        glCallList calls.

    Notes:

        Display lists can be executed between a call to glBegin and
        the corresponding call to glEnd, as long as the display list
        includes only commands that are allowed in this interval.
    
gl-color-3fv ( *v -- )

    Sets the current color.
    
    Parameter <*v> is a 32-bit pointer to an array of 32-bit
    floating point values (C standard float type), which represents
    the red, green and blue elements of a color.
    
gl-gen-lists ( range -- list# )

    Generate a contiguous set of empty display lists
    
    Parameter <range> is an integer value that specifies the number
    of contiguous empty display lists to be generated.

    Return value <list#> points to the first list created.
    <list#>+1 points to the next list.
    <list#>+2 points to the next... and so on, up to range-1 as the
    limit for the number of lists created [0..(range-1)]

gl-new-list ( list mode -- )

    Create or replace a display list.
    
    Parameters <list> and <mode> are integer values.

      list: Specifies the display-list "name", which is an integer
          value pointing to a list# created by gl-gen-lists.

      mode: Specifies the compilation mode, which can be GL_COMPILE
          or GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE.

gl-end-list ( -- )

    Ends a display list generation block.
    
    Parameters: none.

---[ Installation ]--------------------------------------------------

If you are placing all of the Lessons in one directory, copy these
three files to that directory:

        opengl-lesson12.fs      - Code Addendum 1
        opengllib-1.12.fs       - Code Addendum 2
        mini-opengl-1.12.fs     - Code Addendum 3

This Lesson requires the mini-sdl-1.01.fs file from Lesson 6, as well
as all of the usual constants definition files.

This Lesson also uses an image file which you can retrieve from the
NeHe Lesson 12 page at:

      http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/lessons/lesson.asp?lesson=12

or from the opengl-lesson12.zip file that will be posted to the
Taygeta Forth Archives site listed at the start of this column.

For the files from the opengl-lesson12.zip, extract them to wherever
you wish to place them, or extract the above three files and the data
directory into the directory you have placed the previous Lesson
files.

To use the LibUtil script, set the flag in opengllib-1.12.fs:

        1 constant UseLibUtil

and then run the script to install the files to the ~/.gforth dirs:

        cd <your-directory> <cr>
        ./libutil.sh -ra <cr>
        ./libutil.sh -i <cr>
        gforth
        include opengl-lesson12.fs
        lesson12

If you prefer not to use the LibUtil script, set the flag to:

        0 constant UseLibUtil

and then you can execute the Lesson code with:

        cd <your-directory> <cr>
        gforth
        include opengl-lesson12.fs
        lesson12
