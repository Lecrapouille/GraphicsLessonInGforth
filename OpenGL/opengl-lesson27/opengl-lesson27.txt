---[ Information ]---------------------------------------------------

This column will be posted to the Taygeta Forth Achive site:

ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/Archive/tutorials/gforth-sdl-opengl/

in the file:

     opengl-lesson27.zip

along with all required source files.

It may take a little time for the files to be moved to the above
directory, so keep checking until they have been placed there.

---[ Where We Are ]--------------------------------------------------

Read thru the Tutorial for Lesson 27 at

      http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/lessons/lesson.asp?lesson=27

for the description of what is going on with this code.

---[ Additions ]-----------------------------------------------------

Additions to the mini-opengl libcc interface for this lesson are:

gl-cull-face ( mode -- )

    specify whether front- or back-facing facets can be culled
     
    Parameter <mode> is an integer value.

      mode: Specifies whether front- or back-facing facets are
         candidates for culling.
         Symbolic constants GL_FRONT, GL_BACK, and GL_FRONT_AND_BACK
         are accepted. The initial value is GL_BACK.

gl-depth-mask ( flag -- )

    enable or disable writing into the depth buffer

    Parameter <flag> is an integer value.

      flag: Specifies whether the depth buffer is enabled for 
         writing. If flag is GL_FALSE, depth buffer writing is 
         disabled. Otherwise, it is enabled. Initially, depth buffer 
         writing is enabled.

gl-front-face ( mode -- )

    define front- and back-facing polygons
    
    Parameter <mode> is an integer value.

      mode: Specifies the orientation of front-facing polygons. 
         GL_CW and GL_CCW are accepted. 
         The initial value is GL_CCW.

gl-material-fv ( face pname *params -- )

    specify material parameters for the lighting model
    
    Parameters <face> and <pname> are integers; <*params> is a
        pointer to an array of 32-bit floats (SFLOATs)

      face: Specifies which face or faces are being updated. 
         Must be one of GL_FRONT, GL_BACK, or GL_FRONT_AND_BACK.

      pname: Specifies the single-valued material parameter of the 
         face or faces that is being updated. Must be GL_SHININESS.

      *params: Specifies the value that parameter GL_SHININESS will 
         be set to.

---[ Installation ]--------------------------------------------------

If you are placing all of the Lessons in one directory, copy these
files to that directory:

        opengl-lesson27.fs      - Code Addendum 1
        opengllib-1.27.fs       - Code Addendum 2
        mini-opengl-1.27.fs     - Code Addendum 3

This Lesson requires the mini-sdl-1.02.fs file from Lesson 24 as well
as all of the usual constants definition files.

The four data files used by the original code have been incorporated
into the source code of this Lesson.

For the files from the opengl-lesson27.zip, extract them to wherever
you wish to place them, or extract the above files and the data
directory into the directory you have placed the previous Lesson
files.

To use the LibUtil script, set the flag in opengllib-1.27.fs:

        1 =: UseLibUtil

and then run the script to install the files to the ~/.gforth dirs:

        cd <your-directory> <cr>
        ./libutil.sh -ra <cr>
        ./libutil.sh -i <cr>
        gforth
        include opengl-lesson27.fs
        lesson27

If you prefer not to use the LibUtil script, set the flag to:

        0 =: UseLibUtil

and then you can execute the Lesson code with:

        cd <your-directory> <cr>
        gforth
        include opengl-lesson27.fs
        lesson27
