                         by Timothy Trussell

---[ Information ]---------------------------------------------------

This column will be posted to the Taygeta Forth Achive site:

ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/Archive/tutorials/gforth-sdl-opengl/

in the file:

     opengl-lesson02.zip

along with all required source files.

It may take a little time for the files to be moved to the above
directory, so keep checking until they have been placed there.

---[ Where We Are ]--------------------------------------------------

Read thru the Tutorial for Lesson 02 at

                      www.nehe.gamedev.net

for the description of what is going on with this code.

---[ Additions ]-----------------------------------------------------

Additions to the mini-opengl libcc interface for this lesson are:

gl-begin ( mode -- )

    Starts the definition of a list of vertex data

    Parameter <mode> is a GLenum (gforth integer) type, that is
    defined in the glconstants.fs file.

gl-end ( -- )

    Ends the definition of the vertex data started by gl-begin

gl-translate-f ( x y z -- )

    Multiply the current matrix by a translation matrix

    Parameters <x>, <y> and <z> are 32-bit floats.

    If the matrix mode is either GL_MODELVIEW or GL_PROJECTION, all
    objects drawn after a call to glTranslate are translated.
		
    (In gforth, as these are passed by value, there is no conversion
    necessary to make these values into 32-bit floats from the normal
    gforth 64-bit floating point value.)

gl-vertex-3f ( x y z -- )

    Parameters <x>, <y> and <z> are 32-bit floats.

    glVertex commands are used within glBegin/glEnd pairs to specify
    point, line, and polygon vertices. The current color, normal, and
    texture coordinates are associated with the vertex when glVertex
    is called.

    (The parameters are passed by value...)

---[ Installation ]--------------------------------------------------

For the files received from the comp.lang.forth newsgroup, copy these
files:

        opengl-lesson02.fs      - Code Addendum 1
        opengllib-1.02.fs       - Code Addendum 2
        mini-opengl-1.02.fs     - Code Addendum 3

to the same directory with ALL of the files from Lesson 01.

For the files from the opengl-lesson02.zip, extract them to wherever
you wish to place them, or extract the above three files into the
directory you have placed the Lesson 01 files.

From a terminal window, cd to your directory, and execute the LibUtil
program:

        ./libutil.sh -r

to remove the previous mini_opengl_lib compilations (after you have
compiled/run Lesson 01, of course), then execute it again:

        ./libutil.sh -i

to install the libcc interface for this second Lesson.

Then:
        gforth <cr>
        include opengl-lesson02.fs <cr>
        lesson02 <cr>
