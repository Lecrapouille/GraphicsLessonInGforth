                         by Timothy Trussell

---[ Information ]---------------------------------------------------

This column will be posted to the Taygeta Forth Achive site:

ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/Archive/tutorials/gforth-sdl-opengl/

in the file:

     opengl-lesson08.zip

along with all required source files.

It may take a little time for the files to be moved to the above
directory, so keep checking until they have been placed there.

---[ Where We Are ]--------------------------------------------------

Read thru the Tutorial for Lesson 08 at

                      www.nehe.gamedev.net

for the description of what is going on with this code.

---[ Additions ]-----------------------------------------------------

Additions to the mini-opengl libcc interface for this lesson are:

gl-blend-func ( sfactor dfactor -- )

    Specify pixel arithmetic.

   Parameters <sfactor> and <dfactor> are integer values.
   
      sfactor: Specifies how the red, green, blue, and alpha source
          blending factors are computed. The following symbolic
          constants are accepted:

          GL_ZERO, GL_ONE, GL_DST_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_COLOR,
          GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, GL_DST_ALPHA,
          GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA, GL_SRC_ALPHA_SATURATE

          The initial value is GL_ONE. Additionally, if the
          GL_ARB_imaging extension is supported, the following
          constants are accepted:
          
          GL_CONSTANT_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_COLOR,
          GL_CONSTANT_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_ALPHA.

      dfactor: Specifies how the red, green, blue, and alpha
          destination blending factors are computed. Eight symbolic
          constants are accepted:
      
          GL_ZERO, GL_ONE, GL_SRC_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR,
          GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, GL_DST_ALPHA,
          GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA
          
          The initial value is GL_ZERO. Additionally, if the
          GL_ARB_imaging extension is supported, the following
          constants are accepted:
          
          GL_CONSTANT_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_COLOR,
          GL_CONSTANT_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_ALPHA.

gl-color-4f ( red green blue alpha -- )

    Set the current color.
    
    Parameters are 32-bit floats in the range 0.0 to 1.0
    
---[ Installation ]--------------------------------------------------

If you are placing all of the Lessons in one directory, copy these
three files to that directory:

        opengl-lesson08.fs      - Code Addendum 1
        opengllib-1.08.fs       - Code Addendum 2
        mini-opengl-1.08.fs     - Code Addendum 3

This Lesson requires the mini-sdl-1.01.fs file from Lesson 6, as well
as all of the usual constants definition files.

This Lesson also uses an image file which, as with Lesson 6, you can
retrieve immediately from the NeHe Lesson 7 page at:

      http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/lessons/lesson.asp?lesson=08

or from the opengl-lesson08.zip file that will be posted to the
Taygeta Forth Archives site listed at the start of this column.

For the files from the opengl-lesson08.zip, extract them to wherever
you wish to place them, or extract the above three files and the data
directory into the directory you have placed the previous Lesson
files.

To use the LibUtil script, set the flag in opengllib-1.08.fs:

        1 constant UseLibUtil

and then run the script to install the files to the ~/.gforth dirs:

        cd <your-directory> <cr>
        ./libutil.sh -ra <cr>
        ./libutil.sh -i <cr>
        gforth
        include opengl-lesson08.fs
        lesson08

If you prefer not to use the LibUtil script, set the flag to:

        0 constant UseLibUtil

and then you can execute the Lesson code with:

        cd <your-directory> <cr>
        gforth
        include opengl-lesson08.fs
        lesson08
