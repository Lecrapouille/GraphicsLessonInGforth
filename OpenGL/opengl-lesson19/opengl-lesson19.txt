                         by Timothy Trussell

---[ Information ]---------------------------------------------------

This column will be posted to the Taygeta Forth Achive site:

ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/Archive/tutorials/gforth-sdl-opengl/

in the file:

     opengl-lesson19.zip

along with all required source files.

It may take a little time for the files to be moved to the above
directory, so keep checking until they have been placed there.

---[ Where We Are ]--------------------------------------------------

Read thru the Tutorial for Lesson 19 at

                      www.nehe.gamedev.net

for the description of what is going on with this code.

---[ Additions ]-----------------------------------------------------

Additions to the mini-opengl libcc interface for this lesson are:

gl-tex-coord-2d ( s t -- )

    Specifies texture coordinates in two dimensions

    Parameters <s> and <t> are 64-bit doubles (floats).

    The <s> and <t> parameters are the x/y coordinates defining the
    placement of the texture being worked with.

    (As gforth floats are normally 64-bits, there is no conversion
    necessary as they are in the correct format for C/C++ doubles.)

---[ Installation ]--------------------------------------------------

If you are placing all of the Lessons in one directory, copy these
three files to that directory:

        opengl-lesson19.fs      - Code Addendum 1
        opengllib-1.19.fs       - Code Addendum 2
        mini-opengl-1.19.fs     - Code Addendum 3

This Lesson requires the mini-sdl-1.01.fs file from Lesson 6, as well
as all of the usual constants definition files.

This Lesson also uses an image file which you can retrieve from the
NeHe Lesson 19 page at:

      http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/lessons/lesson.asp?lesson=19

or from the opengl-lesson19.zip file that will be posted to the
Taygeta Forth Archives site listed at the start of this column.

For the files from the opengl-lesson19.zip, extract them to wherever
you wish to place them, or extract the above three files and the data
directory into the directory you have placed the previous Lesson
files.

To use the LibUtil script, set the flag in opengllib-1.19.fs:

        1 constant UseLibUtil

and then run the script to install the files to the ~/.gforth dirs:

        cd <your-directory> <cr>
        ./libutil.sh -ra <cr>
        ./libutil.sh -i <cr>
        gforth
        include opengl-lesson19.fs
        lesson19

If you prefer not to use the LibUtil script, set the flag to:

        0 constant UseLibUtil

and then you can execute the Lesson code with:

        cd <your-directory> <cr>
        gforth
        include opengl-lesson19.fs
        lesson19
