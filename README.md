# OpenGL and SDL Graphics Lesson in Gforth.

This github repo is an unofficial mirror of ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/Archive/tutorials/gforth-sdl-opengl/

I made it to create a backup (I don't think they exist in other part than this ftp) and allow Forthers to commit and upgrade these tutorials.
