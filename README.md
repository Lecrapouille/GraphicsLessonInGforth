# OpenGL and SDL Graphics Lesson in Gforth.

This github repo is an unzipped copy of ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/Forth/Archive/tutorials/gforth-sdl-opengl/ with the agreement of the author.

I created it as backup and an easier sharing access than zip and ftp. Forth is a very interessig old language and lot of websites are down and their Forth code source lost. Therefore, in my opinion, for perinity, forth code databases need to be duplicated.
